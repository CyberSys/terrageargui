The current todo list contains the following items, in random order:

- Add support for custom scenery paths.
- Improve layout for larger displays (currently optimised for the mimimum window size).
- Add a "surprise me" option, where the GUI automatically creates scenery after only selecting a bounding box.
- Improve performance of QMapControl.
- Cleanup code.
- Split mainwindow.cpp into multiple files.
